Solutions: 
1) It is the same code as the one printed
2)  counter=1 #declares variable counter with an initial value of 1
    while counter<30:
        #after loops always remember to add ':' and to leave a tab before each line of the loop's code. 
        #Python identifies this as code within the loop
        counter+=1 #increments counter by 1. 
                    #It can also be written as counter=counter+1
        
        # same code as printed 
        
    # when you do not leave tabs and write vertically below or before the loop Python accepts that as a break from the loop
